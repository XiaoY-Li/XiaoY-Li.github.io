I am a Ph.D. student in the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/) at the Nanjing University, under the supervising of Dr. [Jia Liu](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/liujia/). Previously, I received my B.E. degree from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/). My primary research interests focus on AI-driven mobile computing, including wireless localization and intelligent sensing.
